#The Odin Project Library Project

## You can find the live page [here](https://its-sythe.github.io/library-odin/).

This is a simple library with really simple features:  
  i. A add book feature.  
  ii. Checking if book is read or not.  
  iii. Removing the book from the library.  
  iv. A bit of styling.  

#### Missing the storage feature but all in all it was a good learning experience to solidify my understanding of the basic concepts :p
